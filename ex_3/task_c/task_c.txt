# System time and user time
The semaphore makes system calls to make sure it works as planned, and in addition some of the semaphore-connected operations are done in the user space.


# Real time
System + User does not add up to Real, because the program is multi threaded and thus uses more CPU time than the actual wall time passed.
Its like taking two plates out of the dishwasher simultaneously.
